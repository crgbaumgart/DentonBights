# Denton Bights Club (DBC) – Meeting #1 Outline

**Date & Time:** Monday, May19th @ 7:00PM

**Estimated Duration:** ~2 hours

**Host:** MiniMuffin | Fet - [MiniMuffinDFW](https://fetlife.com/MiniMuffinDFW)
	
i. **Identity Consent:** Craig in the streets and MiniMuffin in the lifestyle, my preference is MiniMuffin in kink spaces and Craig everywhere else. 
	
ii. **About**: 

> **Howdy, I’m Craig** — certified spacecadet, mild-weirdo/freak, loves to boulder/kayak/yoga, a proud short-shorts evangelist, cat dad, new puppy parent, and conversational mischief-maker with a soft spot for the weirdos (👋 my people).
> 
> I self-tie, I bottom, then I top—in that order. 
> Rope, for me, is both sacred and playful. It’s a meditative, therapeutic practice where pain and surrender alchemize into something close to bliss. But rope means something different to everyone, and I’m here for all forms of consensual, platonic exploration.
> 
> Kink isn’t new to me—I’ve been kink-adjacent for over a decade. I was a Folsom Street Fair regular from 2014–2019, dated a pro domme for a year, and once shared time with an ex who was/is very involved in the rope scene. I’ve also dipped into the wild sparkle of Burning Man and San Francisco lifestyle and culture, and I’ve learned a lot along the way: mostly that curiosity > ego, and staying two fuck-ups away from disaster is just good policy.
> 
> Since February, I’ve been part of the ShibariStudios rope community. I regularly attend groups like *Single Column Self-Tie, Identities: QueerPOC Nights, DARE,* and *Blender*—and I’m excited to be stepping into *First Bight* and *3 of Canes* next.
> 
> These days, I show up primarily as a rope bottom—masochistic, switchy, and here platonically. I’m Cali sober, but still a respectful psychonaut. I believe in altered states: the floaty bliss of subspace, the quiet hum of endorphin highs, and the alchemy of breath, pressure, and trust. These are edge states—but not escapism. They’re powerful, embodied, and safe when approached with care and consent.
> 
> This group is about co-creating something grounded, queer, educational, weird, and welcoming. A space to explore, connect, socialize, decompress, and maybe drift into a little rope-induced stardust. 🪢🧘‍♂️🪐
